  <div class="post-descr text-justify">
    <p>
      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">I've been learning a lot about simulating and controlling mechanical systems for one of my projects. Of all the math that I learned, the most amazing was the Euler-Lagrange equation.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">$\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_i}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = Q_i$<br /><br />The overarching theme of the control systems that I've been reading about is optimality. And wherever we need optmization, Calculus of variations tends come into the picture. Calculus of Variations is a branch of mathematics that studies the problem of finding functions that minimize the value of a functional (or cost function) in a particular range. As an example, take the range $x \in [0,1]$ on the real line and assume that $f(x)$ is a function that is defined in this range. There are an uncountably infinite different possible functions $f(x)$. A functional is an operation that maps the function $f(x)$ on to a real number. Think of this as a "cost" for the path that the function draws on the graph. The main problem that calculus of variations tries to solve &nbsp;is finding the function $f(x)$ that minimizes the "cost".<br /><br />This area of mathematics has applications in a <i>huge</i>&nbsp;variety of fields and arguably the most important of which is in the field of Physics. Long back some physicists found that the Newtonian Mechanics that everyone knows and loves can be reformulated as an optimization problem. They found that there is a quantity known as "action" (which is defined as kinetic energy - potential energy) that is minimized as particles and other things in the real world go about their daily business. This is commonly known as the "Principle of Least Action". Coming back to the Euler-Lagrange equation, mathematicians figured out that plugging in the functional into this equation gives the constraints of the system that cause it minimize the functional. This means that every single dynamic problem in Newtonian physics can be reformulated as an optimization problem! Pretty neat.<br /><br />So say you have a simple system like a simple pendulum and you want to figure out the equations of motion of system. The way people are used to doing it is drawing a diagram that shows the net forces acting on the system and then deriving the equations of motion using Newton's &nbsp;three laws of motion and energy constraints. Using the Euler-Lagrange equation, the procedure is slightly different and arguably simpler. The first step is to write down the Kinetic and Potential energies of the system.<br /><br />$T = \frac{1}{2} m l^2 \dot{\theta}^2$<br />$V = -m g l \cos{\theta}$<br />$L = \frac{1}{2} m l^2 \dot{\theta}^2 +&nbsp;m g l \cos{\theta}$<br /><br />To get the equations of motion of the system,<br /><br />$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = -b\dot{\theta} + u$<br />Where U is the torque an actuator (motor) at the base of the pendulum gives to the pendulum.<br /><br />This gives:<br /><br />$I\ddot{\theta} + b\dot{\theta}&nbsp;+ m g l \sin{\theta} = u$<br /><br />No fiddling around with forces and no need to try and figure if the net force is zero or not. Just works with pure energies! This works every time as long as you write down the Lagrangian correctly. The first time I saw this, I couldn't believe it worked! For the following few weeks I'd take Lagrangians of random things for fun and check to see if it was giving the correct answers.<br /><br />This also makes me think about the amount of information we need to know 'everything' about a system. Before I learned about the Lagrangian, I had a 'gut-feeling' that in physics, fields were everything. Maybe this is because school and engineering level education in physics focuses a lot on field theories in physics. However, the fact that we can get the complete behaviour of a system from an expression that just encodes the total energy of the system implies that somehow, the energy of the system encodes all the necessary information to describe it completely. The equation suggests to me that potentials and energies are more 'fundamental' in a sense than fields.</div></div>

I spent my whole evening watching every episode of the 2015 season. Seeing my excitement, my friend suggested that I watch this movie called Real Steel which was released in 2011.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The movie is set in a future where human boxing is outlawed (Good!). Instead people watch insanely cool robots go all out against each other for entertainment (Fantastic!). A retired human boxer (Charlie Kenton) &nbsp;who is trying to make it big in the robot boxing (and failing miserably at it) has to spend two months looking after his son (who he hasn't seen in years). Though they are initially cold to each other, the duo eventually learn to work together with a little scrapyard bot called Atom and make it to the Real Steel Tournament, repairing their relationship along the way. The movie is surprisingly heart warming despite the fact that it is about robots fighting violently to their deaths while people cheer (Or maybe it's heartwarming <i>because</i>&nbsp;of that :D ).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what I liked most about the movie was were the robots! Being a robotics enthusiast and having built quite a few robots myself, it's really nice to see more realistic robots being depicted in film. Far too many movies get robots wrong. Most of them vastly over estimate their abilities or completely ignore the laws of physics. I liked the fact that the robot fighters in the movie were controlled via joysticks and had the sort of jerky, non-human movements that characterize robots. I get the feeling that the movie was aiming for realism - which is a goal that I really appreciate, especially when the movie is about a subject like robotics which I'm really passionate about.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The fight scenes between the robots were brilliantly choreographed and genuinely exciting. The urge to cheer on little Atom during the final fight was completely overwhelming.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The movie also gave me a lot to think about. It set my mind a-buzz with ideas about how to implement a robot boxing tournament like that in real life. It also got me thinking about how I would go about designing robots like that. The problem is harder than most people think. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0TaYhjpOfo" target="_blank">This amusing compilation</a> of robots attempting the DARPA Challenge gives you a good idea of how good our robots are in real life. The movie was a satisfying blend of science fiction, robots and very human, emotional moments. Definitely a worthwhile watch.&nbsp;</div></div>

Starting with Harry Potter, The Inheritance Cycle and the Lord of the Rings, fantasy was a staple of the steady diet of books. Then I discovered Famous Five, Secret Seven and other children's adventure novels. I started reading science fiction quite late into my life. Although I read a few books here and there I didn't really get deep into the genre until I read Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Nowadays I tend to prefer science fiction over other genres. So when I found out the the upcoming movie "The Martian" was based on a <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0091956145/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=0091956145&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpashwinnab-21">novel by the same name</a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=httpashwinnab-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=31&amp;a=0091956145" height="1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />, I immediately hunted down the book so I could read it before the movie came out. Turns out the book was pretty short and I finished it by reading on and off during my free time over the past couple of days. So here are my thoughts on the book.</span></div></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Mark Watney is an astronaut on the third manned mission to Mars. Due to an unfortunate and unexpectedly strong dust storm five days into the mission, NASA had to abort. When the crew was making an emergency evacuation from the artificial habitat, the dust storm blows a piece of debris into Mark Watney, impaling him with a piece of metal and taking out the electronics that monitored his vital signs. With no vital signs from Mark's suit and the storm threatening to tip over the vehicle that they needed to lift off from the martian surface, the crew had no choice but to leave his (supposedly) dead body behind. Mark wakes up on Mars after the storm with a slightly leaky suit and the stark realization that he is now stranded on an alien planet. He needs to use his knowledge and resourcefulness to survive on a dusty red wasteland till someone can send help from Earth.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The first thing I noticed about the book was how realistic a lot of the mission terms and procedures seemed to be. The actual structure of the Mars Mission had a lot of the idiosyncrasies of a real mission. The science presented in it appeared to be accurate as well. I decided to look up the author after finishing the novel. It turns out the that the author is a computer programmer who put quite a lot of effort into making sure that the science in the book was reasonably accurate. From his pictures on Wikipedia I think he probably hung around NASA a lot and learned as much as he could about the procedures they follow and how they handle communication with the media and the general public before writing in those parts of the book. The book really gave me an insight into how difficult it can be to communicate science and technology effectively with the public and &nbsp;how important it is to do it right.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As I was reading the book it struck me that Matt Damon is the perfect person to play Mark Watney. With the incessant swearing and wisecracking, it was almost as though the character of Mark Watney was written with Matt Damon in mind. Of course, this is probably confirmation bias on my part but that's what was going through my mind as I read the book.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Martian is also in the Goldilocks Zone with regards to the level of technical detail that the author decided to add in - not too much to turn away a general audience and just enough juicy detail to draw in the science nerds. Being a science nerd myself, I thought the density of science was ideal.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A lot of the story was written from the perspective of Mark Watney as excerpts from his log. The reader is for the most part experiencing the story from the point of view of the man stuck on Mars. This made the novel feel very personal and all the more thrilling. Those brief moments where the writing switched to third person were absolutely spine chilling because in general, the book followed the pattern of switching to third person when things are about to go south.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'The Martian' is an optimistic and very heartwarming exploration of what humans can do together if they really put their minds to it. A lot of people sacrificed a lot of things and a lot of money so that one man could come back to earth from Mars. Rivalries were set aside when the life of another human being was at stake. Would the events have played out similarly in real life? I don't know. But I believe - as the author probably did - that most humans are good at heart. So if asked about the most important thing I learned from the book, I'd say it is the maxim: "Be excellent to each other!". :D<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=IN&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=httpashwinnab-21&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=IN&amp;placement=0091956145&amp;asins=0091956145&amp;linkId=&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true" style="height: 240px; width: 120px;"></p><div><br></div><div><p><br></p></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><br></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><br></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><br></p></div></div></iframe></div></div>

  <div class="post-descr text-justify">
    <p>
      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">The Ashley Madison website was hacked about a month ago and hackers stole gigabytes of user data including their full names, addresses and credit card data. On August 18, the hackers released all this data on the web. Now all this sounds really bad until you find out what Ashley Madison actually does. It's a website for men and women in a committed relationship to find other men and women in a committed relationship and have an affair. So while many disagree with the amount of information that the hackers actually released, I'm sure that a lot of people around the world are secretly happy that the data was stolen.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Infidelity is a despicable thing. I know how incredibly hurt and betrayed I would feel if I found out that my partner was cheating on me. The people who run the site are not doing anything illegal but they are complete assholes. Yes, it's true that the activities of the company are completely legal (as their public statements keep reminding us) but I think that in a way, this hack is the internet's way of telling Ashley Madison what gigantic dickheads they are for providing a platform for people to break promises.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, despite the obvious reprehensibility of the target of the hack I don't condone the actions of its perpetrators. In fact, I would say that stealing personal information and violating the privacy of thousands of people is just as bad - if not worse. Releasing personal information on the internet often leads to online mobs carrying out witchhunts similar to what happened on reddit in the aftermath of the Boston Bombing incident. Two wrongs don't make a right.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing. But it doesn't protect you from criticism. In fact when you're doing appalling things, people around you have a right to call you out on it. The idea that I'm trying to explain is beautifully conveyed&nbsp;<a href="https://xkcd.com/1357/" target="_blank">by this xkcd comic</a>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4YPBESG5Z-8/VdVPJAsJjJI/AAAAAAAAFX8/z5pK21SQmSo/s1600/free_speech.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4YPBESG5Z-8/VdVPJAsJjJI/AAAAAAAAFX8/z5pK21SQmSo/s640/free_speech.png" width="626" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Alt text:&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; white-space: pre-wrap;">I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />So the people at Ashley Madison should take this as a hint. No, what you're doing is not illegal but a lot of people (even some evil people) think it's contemptible. And they're showing you the door.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div>

Yesterday that random movie turned out to be Whiplash - a movie about an aspiring drummer and his well intentioned but abusive mentor.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I loved the movie but I disagree with the opinions of Terence Fletcher. There is a scene in the movie where he is asked if there is a line. If there is a limit which if he crosses he might actually discourage his student from becoming the next great musician that the world loves. And he replies that there is no such limit because the next great won't be discouraged. While that's a cute sentiment, I think he's wrong. The world isn't divided into 'The Greats' and talentless people. There are plenty of people who fall in between the spectrum. And I think that by not caring about those who are not destined to be 'Great' and even actively doing things that could damage them mentally he is doing more harm than good. Additionally, I think that there are a lot of people who respond much better to constructive criticism and positive reinforcement than to abuse hurled at them. For every person with a story about an abusive mentor who made them who they are, I think there are a few dozen people with stories about how their incredibly supportive and positive mentor inspired them to be their best.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So while the story was inspiring, I really hope that people don't use Terence as an inspiration.&nbsp; </div></div>
