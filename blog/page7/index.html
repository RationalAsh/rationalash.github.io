  <div class="post-descr text-justify">
    <p>
      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">So I decided to start using an electric kettle to prepare myself some coffee from this semester onwards. I naively thought that this was a simple matter of unpacking the electric kettle that I had stored away in my cupboard for the last two years, boiling some water in it and getting delicious, steaming coffee. Life is rarely that simple.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I first plugged the kettle into a spike buster that I have in my room. In about five minutes I hear a electric whizzle and see a quick burst of electric white sparks coming from my spike buster. Oops. I blew a fuse. I checked the electrical rating of my kettle. It was rated for 13A and 250V. I checked the fuse of the spike buster. It was rated for 13A and 250V. I guess I was driving the poor instrument at it's limit! Brushing aside the problem of getting a new fuse for the spike buster, I decided to see if it was possible to run the kettle directly off the wall socket.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">But just before I connected the kettle and turned it on, I paused for a second. The memory of the white sparks was still fresh in my mind. So I decided to figure out whether the wall socket that I had in my room was capable of delivering the 250V 13A that the kettle required before I plugged it in and possible caused a fire that burned the whole building down.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So I started researching on plugs. Boring? Absolutely not! It turns out that engineers are very systematic creatures that draw up standards for pretty much everything under the sun. So I started hunting for the standards for electrical plugs in India. After a bit of googling I found that there are three standard types of plugs used for wall sockets in India; Types C, D, and M.</div><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GfcVWLvUwf8/U8GKfaHTXsI/AAAAAAAACEA/Cu9a1nntZZ4/s1600/electricity-tiles-type-C-200-px.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GfcVWLvUwf8/U8GKfaHTXsI/AAAAAAAACEA/Cu9a1nntZZ4/s1600/electricity-tiles-type-C-200-px.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Type C</td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JaGS_JxDwTg/U8GLVCs-oTI/AAAAAAAACEQ/a-PJ_GePFCs/s1600/electricity-tiles-type-M-200-px.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JaGS_JxDwTg/U8GLVCs-oTI/AAAAAAAACEQ/a-PJ_GePFCs/s1600/electricity-tiles-type-M-200-px.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Type M</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YXnaODD67p8/U8GKvs_BYtI/AAAAAAAACEI/AyFWc3hy-7M/s1600/electricity-tiles-type-D-200-px.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YXnaODD67p8/U8GKvs_BYtI/AAAAAAAACEI/AyFWc3hy-7M/s1600/electricity-tiles-type-D-200-px.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Type D</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Since I wasn't too interested in the Type C plug (I didn't have any in my room) I pulled up some specs on the plugs. I lifted all this stuff directly from <a href="http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/">this website.</a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">[The Type D plug] has three round prongs that form a triangle. It is a <b>5A plug</b>. The central earth pin is 20.6 mm long and has a diameter of 7.1 mm. The 5.1 mm line and neutral pins are 14.9 mm long, on centres spaced 19.1 mm apart. The centre-to-centre distance between the grounding pin and the middle of the imaginary line connecting the two power pins is 22.2 mm. Type M, which has larger pins and is rated at 15 amps, is used alongside type D for larger appliances in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Pakistan. Some sockets can take both type M and type D plugs.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">Although type D is now almost exclusively used in India and Nepal, it can still occasionally be found in hotels in the UK. It should be noted that tourists should not attempt to connect anything to a BS 546 round-pin outlet found in the UK as it is likely to be on a circuit that has a special purpose: e.g. for providing direct current (DC) or for plugging in lamps that are controlled by a light switch or a dimmer.</blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><b>Type D plugs are among the most dangerous ones in the world</b>: the prongs are not insulated (i.e. the pin shanks do not have a black covering towards the plug body like type C, G, I, L or N plugs), which means that if a type D plug is pulled halfway out, its prongs are still connected to the socket! Little children run the risk of electrocuting themselves when pulling such a plug out and putting their fingers around it. Type D outlets are not recessed into the wall, so they do not provide any protection from touching the live pins either.</blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/d/&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">[The Type M plug] the Indian type D plug, but its pins are much larger. Type M is a <b>15 amp plug</b>, which has three round prongs that form a triangle. The central earth pin is 28.6 mm long and has a diameter of 8.7 mm. The 7.1 mm line and neutral pins are 18.6 mm long, on centres spaced 25.4 mm apart. The centre-to-centre distance between the grounding pin and the middle of the imaginary line connecting the two power pins is 28.6 mm.&nbsp;</blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/m/&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So I got out my ruler and decided to go ahead and measure my wall socket to see which plug type it was. First I measured the holes. My earth pin had a diameter of 8.7 mm and my live and neutral pins had a diameter of 7.1 mm. I thought that was it! I'd determined that my plug was of Type M! But there was a little unexpected twist! I then measured the spacing between the centres of the live and neutral pins just for fun and found that it was 19.1 mm! This thoroughly confused me. Here was a wall socket that had the pin diameters of a Type M socket but had the pin spacings of a Type D socket! I was unsure what to do! What I wanted to know was the current rating of the wall socket. If the socket had the current rating of Type M then it can supply up to 15A and I can safely run my kettle from it. However, if the socket had the current rating of Type D then it could only supply 5A and I would risk setting something on fire.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So I dived back into the internet and dug deeper. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the organization that keeps track of the standards for all the stuff in India and I found that the code for the electrical plug standards is "IS1293". Weird.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">So I <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/in/bis/S05/is.1293.2005.pdf">dug up the pdf</a> of that standard and started reading through it. After skimming through the material at high speed I found what I was looking for on <b>page 83</b>&nbsp;of that document. The page had actual measurements of the wall sockets. They did not have a plug type with the weird combination of measurements that I measured. So I decided to think about it a bit. Obviously, Type M plugs which are 25.4 mm apart won't fit into this socket that I have even if the pin diameter matches. Since the socket pin spacing was 19.1 mm I assume/deduce that it was not meant to supply power to devices with Type M plugs. So from that page on the standards, this wall socket that I have must either supply 6A or 10A. Since both those values are below the rated 13A for my electric kettle, I think that I should not use it at the moment. I think I'll ask some people in the college about the actual current ratings of the plugs in my room but for now, no kettle.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>TL;DR</b>: Dammit! I can't use my kettle!</div></div>

      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">When I first came across the problem of inverse kinematics I thought - quite naively - that it would be a simple matter to find a solution to the problem because the forward kinematics problem was so simple to solve. I decided to start out with a 2 link arm and see if I could work out the solution on my own from scratch without having any initial knowledge about inverse kinematics. After filling pages and pages with calculations that didn't quite seem to be going anywhere I realized why it was such a difficult problem.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Of course a 2 link arm had a complete close form solution. After a bit of online research I found the solution. However, the solution for arms with more than 2 degrees of freedom turns out to be not so simple. It requires using numerical methods to slowly converge on a solution. This approach doesn't solve everything either. There's still the problem of choosing the right set of angles because there are often multiple solutions for a particular location of the end of the arm and some of these solutions are invalid because they are outside the range of motion of the motors at the joints of the arm.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I've decided to slowly familiarize myself with all the different ways of finding inverse kinematics solutions. I think I'll make blogposts each with a higher degree of freedom and eventually I'll talk about the solution for the 6DOF arm. Why stop at 6? Because it turns out that in 3D space, you don't need more than 6DOF to reach a particular location/orientation. Any more than that and your arm becomes redundant. 3DOF for location in space plus 3DOF for orientation in space are all we need from an arm.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So in this post I'll talk about the solution to 2 link robotic arm. And this arm will have hinge type joints only. I think that the technical term used is "revolute joint".<br /><br />A 2 link planar robotic arm looks like this:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=259194268438499485" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0U96P1LBNho/U7-3ouDVYWI/AAAAAAAACDw/If5OrvBZtj8/s1600/2RManip.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="466" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0U96P1LBNho/U7-3ouDVYWI/AAAAAAAACDw/If5OrvBZtj8/s1600/2RManip.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The forward kinematics equations for this arrangement are simple enough.<br />$x = l_1 cos(\theta_1) + l_2 cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)$<br />$y = l_1 sin(\theta_1) + l_2 sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)$<br /><br />The inverse kinematics equations are quite monstrous. The full derivation is <a href="http://www.hessmer.org/uploads/RobotArm/Inverse%2520Kinematics%2520for%2520Robot%2520Arm.pdf" target="_blank">given in this fantastic pdf</a>. I'll just write down the final equations here.<br /><br />Given a value of x and y, the inverse kinematics equations are:<br />Let<br />$k_1 = l_1 + l_2 cos(\theta_2)$<br />$k_2 = l_2 sin(\theta_2)$<br />$\gamma = atan2(k_2, k_1)$<br /><br />$\theta_2 = atan2(\sqrt{1 - (\frac{x^2 + y^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2l_1 l_2})^2}, \frac{x^2 + y^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2l_1 l_2})$<br />$\theta_1 = atan2(y, x) - \gamma$<br /><br />I wrote a simple python script to calculate the values of theta. You can get the code <a href="https://github.com/RationalAsh/invkin/blob/master/invkin.py">here.</a>&nbsp;The invkin2() function calculates the values of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ for an arm with 2 links.<br /><br />It was a bit difficult to test the code this way though. Can't see if I'm right or wrong in most cases. So I wrote this processing sketch to visualize the calculations so I can easily verify their correctness.<br /><br />You can view the processing simulation here:&nbsp;<a href="http://rationalash.github.io/invkin/">http://rationalash.github.io/invkin/</a><br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div><script type="text/javascript">MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset",MathJax.Hub]);</script></div>

  <div class="post-descr text-justify">
    <p>
      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">I've been thinking about switching to tiling window managers ever since I discovered the awesome tiling features of Emacs. But there were a lot of things that kept me bound to a desktop environment like Gnome. The network manager was the biggest thing. Since I use a mobile internet connection more often than WiFi I regularly had to use the network manager app in Ubuntu to configure and edit these connections (They're a bit temperamental). But after a while my curiosity got the best of me and I finally decided to give it a go.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">My initial choice was the awesome window manager. I picked it because it seemed popular and a lot of people on Linux forums were recommending it. Despite all the praise people seemed to have for it, I didn't quite like it. I'd spend ages trying to get all the windows in exactly the order and tiling configuration I wanted and even then it was a bit tricky to navigate. There was also the fact that I needed to learn the Lua programming language to configure it.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Then I came across the i3 window manager. I went to YouTube and watched a couple of videos of people trying it out and was reasonably impressed with the degree of flexibility it offered. I liked the tree based structure they used to implement their containers and loved the way I could open new tiled windows in any orientation I wanted by using a simple keyboard shortcut. I found that I preferred it to the weird interface that awesome provided.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So now that I was stuck with i3, I needed to tackle the huge challenge of getting all the monitoring programs working inside it. I use a laptop that is quite prone to overheating. So I needed a temperature monitoring program to update the CPU's current temperature to a bar that's visible across all workspaces. I needed to know the current temperature of the system with a quick glance. I also needed the network manager applet and a Guake terminal running. Also, the default font that i3 uses looks really ugly. So I needed to figure out how to change that as well. i3 doesn't require you to know some weird obscure programming language like Lua to configure it. It used simple text files for configuration!&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Once I had the basic stuff configured I needed to tackle the biggest annoyance with simple window managers - no simple interface for suspend, lock, shutdown and logout. Ok logout is simple. I just need to press Mod4+Shift+e to exit the window manager but suspending the laptop and locking its screen were a bit tricky.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After hours of googling I found a really neat script online which handled everything. It even had a neat pyGtk GUI. I downloaded the script, modified a little bit to suit my needs and bound it to Mod4+Esc. And there's this really neat program called xautolock which puts the computer to sleep when I don't use it for a while.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I've uploaded all my config files to my github account here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/RationalAsh/configs">https://github.com/RationalAsh/configs</a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So finally here's how my laptop looks now:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dxZ3pbRAh90/U7VT2UnonWI/AAAAAAAACDQ/sueHrEAiavU/s1600/Screenshot+from+Thu+Jul++3+18:28:28+IST+2014.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dxZ3pbRAh90/U7VT2UnonWI/AAAAAAAACDQ/sueHrEAiavU/s1600/Screenshot+from+Thu+Jul++3+18:28:28+IST+2014.png" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>It was a bit of a pain to fiddle around with config files for hours to get all the basic functionality up and running but I quite like the freedom it gives me to make my desktop look however I want it to look! :D<br /><br /></div>

      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">A few days ago I came across this new blogging platform called Ghost. It had a <b>very </b>successful funding campaign over at <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform" target="_blank">kickstarter.</a>&nbsp;It was funded 8 times above the goal!!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So to find out what all this fuss was about I decided to try it out! Go ahead and watch the demo video over at <a href="https://ghost.org/features" target="_blank">their website</a>. It gives a good overview of the thing. I was intrigued by their approach. Unlike most of the blogging platforms that exist today, it uses markdown to format the blogposts. Both blogger and wordpress use a WYSIWYG editor. I was skeptical about this approach. At first glance the markdown looked intimidating. I was unsure if it would be a good idea to replace simple WYSIWYG editors with markdown.</div><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Setting it up</b></span><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Once I signed up for the thing I found out that they hadn't released a hosted version of their site yet. My dashboard said that I had to download the source code to try it out. &nbsp;The setup looked pretty simple. So I decided to go ahead with it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">First I installed node.js and npm with a simple sudo apt-get install and followed the instructions over at <a href="http://docs.ghost.org/installation/linux/" target="_blank">this page</a>. There was a minor hiccup here. The thing didn't seem to have installed properly. Then I discovered that this was because apt-get installs an older version of the node.js libraries. So I followed the instructions <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16302436/install-nodejs-on-ubuntu-12-10" target="_blank">over here</a>&nbsp;and installed the latest version from the PPA.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After that I ran `sudo rm -rf ` node modules to delete traces of the previous installation attempt and then ran npm install --production again and it worked fine.</div><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Impressions</b></span><br /><br />So here it is, up and running!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pyh6zdDVed0/UoyzpXoK9oI/AAAAAAAABZU/4A2Kmrs1uWA/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-11-20+18:34:48.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pyh6zdDVed0/UoyzpXoK9oI/AAAAAAAABZU/4A2Kmrs1uWA/s640/Screenshot+from+2013-11-20+18:34:48.png" height="360" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Then I created a test post to test out the syntax of the markdown and I was blown away! It was much better than it looked in the video! The markdown is surprisingly intuitive once you start typing. A lot of the syntax is very similar to the Org mode in emacs and the syntax for adding links and images is exactly the same as on reddit. I found myself formatting it quite naturally without needing to refer to the syntax guide.</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7rSAZb2XzY8/Uoy3rll2klI/AAAAAAAABZg/kb1k3rYF40k/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-11-20+18:52:05.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7rSAZb2XzY8/Uoy3rll2klI/AAAAAAAABZg/kb1k3rYF40k/s640/Screenshot+from+2013-11-20+18:52:05.png" height="360" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Although the idea of using markdown didn't sound so inviting when I saw the video I liked it once I actually started typing. Although there were a few small hiccups(like the list formatting not working if I didn't leave an empty line before it. I think this one's my fault though XD) I really liked the overall idea. It's definitely convenient to not have to interrupt my typing for using the WYSIWYG editor buttons.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">One other big advantage that I see is the ease with which I can import and export posts with all the formatting preserved. Since all the formatting information is contained in plain text, I just have do a simple copy paste! I think I'll migrate all my personal blogs to my local version of Ghost.</div><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Final Verdict</b></span><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I think it's an awesome idea! Although the platform is &nbsp;a bit short on features now I think that's mostly because it's under active development. I think it's really good idea and that it has the potential to become something really big. This could turn out to be the future of blogging. Also, they say on their website that the company will be registering as a non profit company and that the platform itself is open source! I think Ghost is to blogging what GNOME is to user interfaces.</div></div>
