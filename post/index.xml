      <description>&lt;p&gt;My old website was formatted a lot like an online resume - something I feel doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit me any more after I decided to join a PhD program. So I decided to refresh my website deisgn into something that fit my current research interests. I also wanted a platform where I could blog about my work and personal projects. I&amp;rsquo;ve read blogs by many active researchers and I feel that the informal tone and nature of a blog allows more accessible explanations of research than formal journal/conference papers - where the language can often be very terse and full of jargon. A few excellent research blogs that I was inspired by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://studywolf.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Studywolf&lt;/a&gt; - About robotics and control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jeremykun.com/2014/01/17/how-to-conquer-tensorphobia/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Math âˆ© Programming&lt;/a&gt; Math and programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://colah.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;colah&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt; - A blog by a researcher at Google about machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like for my old website, I decided to go with a static website which allows me to host the site for free using Github pages. I used a static site generator called &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. However, I found it a bit time consuming to use. I wanted to spend more time focusing on the content of the website and less on the setup. So I did a little research on other static site generators that I can use and came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed to have all the nice features that a static site generator should have. It works across all operatings systems, had a lot of free themes, was open source and most importantly was easy to set up. I was able to get a basic website generated in under two minutes by following their getting started tutorial. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a good static site generator, I highly recommend Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
