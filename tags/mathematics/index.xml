      <description>Introduction As is the case for a lot of PhDs, my main work focuses on a small part of robotics. There are many areas of robotics that I would love to work on but do not. As part of my ongoing effort to learn more about these areas, I work on accessible problems that interest me. One area of robotics that fascinates me is that of rigid body dynamics and control.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time working with inertial measurement units recently and am discovering the surprising amount of mathematics that goes into using data from accelerometers and gyroscopes to get the orientation of an object in 3D space. The story begins with me trying to integrate an angular velocity vector (in 3D) to get the orientation of an object. Angular velocity is a vector but common representations of orientation (like Euler Angles) are not.</description>
